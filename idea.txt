You should use all the same optimized ideal arithmetic and
exponentiation methods, including precomputations where appropriate, for
both algorithms.  Performance of ideal arithmetic and exponentiation is
compared elsewhere in your thesis - here, you want to focus the
comparison on the algorithmic improvements to the factoring algorithm
itself with all other components being equal, in order to demonstrate
that these changes themselves yield practical improvements.  So, you
want to compare the basic SPAR (Pollard for search, theoretically
optimal choice of exponent and search length) vs. the improved version
(bounded primorial steps for search, empirically optimized choices of
exponent and bounds, any other tweaks you've made to the SPAR algorithm
itself).

This fits with the same general theme I've been saying - you should
present evidence that every new idea / optimization you incorporate has
a positive effect by itself.  What I've written above will help you do
that at the level of the factoring algorithm.
